	<h1>Hi! My name is Emma. </h1>

	<p>I am an art director at Miami Ad School. I recently graduated from Vanderbilt University in May, and started at Miami Ad in July. 

	<p>I am originally from Irvington, New York, just a half hour train ride away from NYC. 

	<p>I have no experience with coding, except that my roommate in college was an engineer. I always saw her doing work like this- I never thought it would be me!!!
